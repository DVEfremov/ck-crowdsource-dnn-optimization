Introduction
============

This [CK-powered] (http://github.com/ctuning/ck) open-source cross-platform desktop demo app (at least, for Linux and Windows) based on QT to recognize images via Caffe or TensorFlow, and send reports (timing/correctness/etc) to CK.

You can download this app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.video.experiments). 

You can also find public results at [Live CK repo](http://cknowledge.org/repo)!

Public scenarios are prepared using this [CK GitHub repo](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-crowd-scenarios).
Caffe libraries are generated using [CK-Caffe framework](https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe).

Current scenarios include multi-dimensional and multi-objective
optimization of benchmarks and real workloads such as 
Caffe, TensorFlow and other DNN frameworks in terms
of performance, accuracy, energy, memory footprint, cost, etc.

See our [vision paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2909437.2909449).

Minimal requirements
====================
Linux, Windows or MacOS operation system

Preparation to run
====================
After source code built, executable file lays down into _bin_ directory inside the project directory.

Create _app.conf_ file inside the _bin_ directory, which contains info about your local CK installation:
```
[General]
ck_exe_name=./ck
ck_bin_path=/path/to/your/ck/bin
ck_repos_path=~/CK
```
Or you can copy dummy file _src/app.conf.example_ into _bin_ and use it as template.

To make application run you have to install at least one package from each of three categories: dnn-proxy, caffemodel, imagenet dataset.

* dnn-proxy packages:
`$ ck install package:dnn-proxy-caffe-cpu`
`$ ck install package:dnn-proxy-caffe-opencl`
`$ ck install package:dnn-proxy-caffe-cuda`

* caffe models:
`$ ck install package:caffemodel-bvlc-alexnet`
`$ ck install package:caffemodel-bvlc-googlenet`

* imagenet datasets:
`$ ck install package:imagenet-2012-aux`
`$ ck install package:imagenet-2012-val`

Privacy Policy
==============

This application requires access to your Camera to let you
capture images, recognize them and collect various performance 
statistics. Note that, by default, no images are sent to public servers!
Only if misprediction happens, you are encouraged but not obliged (!)
to submit incorrectly recognized image with the correct label 
to the public server to help the community enhance existing
data sets with new images!
